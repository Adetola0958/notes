                        ABOUT THE PROJECT
Trying thisproject out has bee an interesting one. I created three components, and the are Form.js, Sticker.js and useReducer.js

In the Form.js, I created the form tag, and created the function for adding new note. In the creating a new note, I consumed the value provied by the context in the useReducer component. I made use of the dispatch for the action types. Types "ADD_NOTE_SUCCESS" and "DELETE_NOTE_SUCCESS" were created in the useReducer components.

In the useReducer component. I made sure I created the useReducer, and made it resuable as a logic, by creating a context, and nreturning the state ad dispatch as provided values for components to use. This logis=c works like the render props is class based component. The useReducer component keeeps the state as initial state, and creates the actions to be dispatched. The stickies component is passed in as a child component in the useReducer. The Sticker is created in tgeh reducer which return back the JSX sending th Stickies wrapped by the Provider of the context created 

In the Stickies component, this is the component that is passed as a child component in App.js. This is where the sticky notes are bein mapped to be displayed. And in the stickies is where items are being set in thelocal storage, and also gotten from the local storage.
